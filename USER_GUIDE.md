# User guide

Primitive guide for users 1.3.0 and above (need to expand)

## Applying the Plugin
For both _standard_ and _flexible_ applications, include the plugin in your pom.xml:

```XML
...
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.google.cloud.tools</groupId>
      <artifactId>appengine-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>VERSION</version>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

The [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) is required for this plugin to
function. Download and install it before running any tasks.

## App Engine Standard
The plugin will target the App Engine standard environment if you include an `appengine-web.xml`
in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/`, otherwise it will assume it is an [App Engine flexible](#app-engine-flexible)
application.

### Goals
For App Engine standard, the plugin exposes the following goals :

#### Local Run

| Goal    | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `run`   | Run the application locally. |
| `start` | Start the application in the background. |
| `stop`  | Stop a running application. |

#### Deployment

| Goal             | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `stage`          | Stage an application for deployment. |
| `deploy`         | Deploy an application. |
| `deployCron`     | Deploy cron configuration. |
| `deployDispatch` | Deploy dispatch configuration. |
| `deployDos`      | Deploy dos configuration. |
| `deployIndex`    | Deploy datastore index configuration. |
| `deployQueue`    | Deploy queue configuration. |

### Configuration
Once you've [initialized](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing) `gcloud` you can run and deploy
your application using the defaults provided by the plugin.

To see the generated documentation for goals and parameters including default values, execute the
following:

```bash
$  mvn appengine:help -Ddetail
```

If you wish to customize your configuration, the plugin can be configured using the usual
`<configuration>` element.

##### Cloud SDK configuration

| Parameter          | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| ~~`cloudSdkPath`~~ | Deprecated in favor if `cloudSdkHome` |
| `cloudSdkHome`     | Location of the Cloud SDK. |
| `cloudSdkVersion`  | Desired version of the Cloud SDK. (e.g. "192.0.0") |

The cloud sdk will be installed/updated/verified depending on which parameters are configured:

| Parameters Specified   | Action |
| ---------------------- | ------ |
| None                   | Latest version of the cloud sdk is downloaded and installed. |
| Both parameters        | Current cloud sdk installation at `cloudSdkHome` is verified. |
| `cloudSdkHome` only    | No verification. |
| `cloudSdkVersion` only | Cloud sdk at specified version is downloaded and installed. |

The cloud sdk is installed in `$USER_HOME/.cache/google-cloud-tools-java/managed-cloud-sdk/<version>/google-cloud-sdk`
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%/google-cloud-tools-java/managed-cloud-sdk/<version>/google-cloud-sdk` on Windows). 
The cloud sdk installation/verification occurs automatically before running any appengine goals.

### How do I deploy my project Configuration Files?

You can now deploy the cron/dos/etc. configuration files separately using the new goals:

* `deployCron`
* `deployDispatch`
* `deployDos`
* `deployIndex`
* `deployQueue`

_For GAE Flexible projects_ The deployment source directory can be overridden by setting the `appEngineDirectory` parameter in the deploy configuration.

For standard it defaults to `<stagingDirectory>/WEB-INF/appengine-generated` (and `stagingDirectory`
defaults to `${project.build.directory}/appengine-staging`). You should probably
not change this configuration, for standard configured projects, this is the location that your
xml configs are converted into yaml for deployment.

### How do I debug Dev Appserver v1?

You can debug the Dev App Server v1 using the jvmFlags:

```XML
<configuration>
  <jvmFlags>
    <jvmFlag>
        -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=5005,server=y,suspend=n
    </jvmFlag>
  </jvmFlags>
</configuration>
```

### How do I enable hot reload of my application?

To enable hot reload of classes, you must tell the Dev App Server v1 to scan for changes :
```XML
<configuration>
  <jvmFlags>
    <jvmFlag>
        -Dappengine.fullscan.seconds=5
    </jvmFlag>
  </jvmFlags>
</configuration>
```
While your app is running, just run `mvn war:exploded` to reflect your changes into the running application.

### How do I put datastore somewhere else (so it's not deleted across rebuilds)?

```XML
<configuration>
  <jvmFlags>
    <jvmFlag>
        -Ddatastore.backing_store=/path/to/my/local_db.bin
    </jvmFlag>
  </jvmFlags>
</configuration>
```

### How do I run multiple modules on the Dev App Server v1?

Multimodule support can be done by adding all the runnable modules to a single module's configuration (which currently must be an appengine-standard application).

```XML
<configuration>
  <services>
    <service>${project.build.directory}/${project.name}-${project.version}</service>
    <service>${project.parent.basedir}/other_module/target/other_module_finalName-${project.version}</service>
  </services>
</configuration>
```

### I want to use Dev Appserver 2 (alpha), how do I switch to it?

To switch back to the Dev App Server v2-alpha (that was default in version < 1.3.0) use the `devserverVersion` parameter

```XML
<configuration>
   <devserverVersion>2-alpha</devserverVersion>
</configuration>
```

### How can I pass environment variables to the Dev Appserver (both v1 and v2-alpha)?

You can pass environment variables directly to the Dev App Server:

```XML
<configuration>
  <environment>
    <VARIABLE_NAME>value</VARIABLE_NAME>
  </environment>
</configuration>
```

### How can I pass additional arguments to the Dev Appserver (both v1 and v2-alpha)?

You can pass additional arguments directly to the Dev App Server:

```XML
<configuration>
  <additionalArguments>
    <additionalArgument>--ARG1</additionalArgument>
    <additionalArgument>--ARG2</additionalArgument>
  </additionalArguments>
</configuration>
```
